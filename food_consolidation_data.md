## Notes on Data Quality

1. **Dairy farm counts** vary by definition: "farms with milk cows" (Census of Agriculture) vs. "licensed dairy operations" (USDA NASS annual surveys) vs. "farms selling milk." The Census counts tend to be higher because they include any farm with even one milk cow, while licensed dairy counts are lower but more relevant to commercial dairy.

2. **Farm counts pre-1970** come from decennial Census publications and historical USDA statistical bulletins. Post-1997 data is available through the USDA NASS QuickStats database.

3. **CR4 ratios** for meatpacking come from USDA Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) data, now part of USDA Agricultural Marketing Service. The 2023 Schaefer et al. paper published by USDA provides updated plant-level measures.

4. **Seed/agrochemical concentration** data post-2018 mergers is estimated because the mergers involved divestitures (e.g., Bayer sold seed assets to BASF), making precise post-merger CR4 calculations complex.

5. Some values marked "est." are interpolated from known data points and documented percentage changes between census years.
